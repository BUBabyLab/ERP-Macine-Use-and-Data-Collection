 P50 Waveform: measure's an individual's ability to selectively attend to salient stimuli and ignore redundant information 

 N100/N1 wave: a negative deflection peaking between 90-200 ms that peaks when an novel stimulus occurs and can be matched with previous stimuli 

 P200/P2 Wave: positive deflection peaking between 100-250 ms after stimulus N200/N2 Wave: peaks about 200 ms after stimulus presentation. Comprises mismatch negativity (MMN), N2b and N2c N300 

 P300: has a latency range of 250-400 ms representing attention to an "oddball paradigm" which is a stimulus that differs or occurs less frequently than the standard stimulus 

 N400: 300-600 ms post stimulus latency related to the word one would anticipate to come at the end of a sentence (ex: I have to take my dog to the vet versus I have to take my dog to the water fountain) 

 P600: latency around 600 ms, refers to language and syntax

 MRCP: movement related cortical potential 

 CNV: contingent negative variation 

 PINV: post imperative negative variation
 
 
ERP Machine Use
Measure the head in centimeters from brows to occipital bones and measure over the ears 
Select the cap with the tag that corresponds to the measurement
Apply stickers to the back of the red and blue electrode collars
use the chart to attach electrode cables to the cap (do not apply GRND until step 28)
use Qtip to apply gel to the back of the subject's neck 
wipe with alcohol prep pad and paper towel 
use Qtip to apply gel to the left and right mastoids
wipe with alcohol prep pad and paper towel
use Qtip to apply nuprep gel below the left eye 
apply gel to left and right mastoid 
wipe with alcohol prep pad and paper towel
Plug electrodes into the impedance meter and turn on the impedance meter
blue and/or red gets plugged into the +/-
green is always neutral
peel back the sticker on the red electrode and place on the back of the skull (base of neck) to the left or right of the spinal cord 
repeat for blue electrode on the other side of the base of the neck to the left or right of the spinal cord
press the white button on the impedance meter to turn it on
Place the corresponding electrodes from the white cap electrodes onto the left and right horizontal eye and below the left eye  
fill a syringe with gel
stir gel into each electrode using the back of a Qtip
use the green electrode on the impedance meter to ensure that every electrode reads a ch of under 50 kilo ohms 
when reading the red and blue electrodes, place the meter next to and slightly below the electrodes using the green electrode, do not place on top
place on top for the white ones
place cap on the head (tag in the back)
fill the electrodes with gel and stir the inside of the electrrodes with a qtip
measure with impedance meter to make sure the ch reads below 50 kilo ohms 
place the GRND electrode in 
remove the red and blue electrodes from the back of the neck
ask subject to bring the box with them as they move into the testing chamber
