 P50 Waveform: measure's an individual's ability to selectively attend to salient stimuli and ignore redundant information 

 N100/N1 wave: a negative deflection peaking between 90-200 ms that peaks when an novel stimulus occurs and can be matched with previous stimuli 

 P200/P2 Wave: positive deflection peaking between 100-250 ms after stimulus 
 
 Tori is such a great Instructor!
 
N200/N2 Wave: peaks about 200 ms after stimulus presentation. Comprises mismatch negativity (MMN), N2b and N2c N300 

 P300: has a latency range of 250-400 ms representing attention to an "oddball paradigm" which is a stimulus that differs or occurs less frequently than the standard stimulus 

 N400: 300-600 ms post stimulus latency related to the word one would anticipate to come at the end of a sentence (ex: I have to take my dog to the vet versus I have to take my dog to the water fountain) 

 P600: latency around 600 ms, refers to language and syntax

 MRCP: movement related cortical potential 

 CNV: contingent negative variation 

 PINV: post imperative negative variation
