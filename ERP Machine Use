ERP Machine Use
Measure the head in centimeters from brows to occipital bones and measure over the ears 
Select the cap with the tag that corresponds to the measurement
Apply stickers to the back of the red and blue electrode collars
use the chart to attach electrode cables to the cap (do not apply GRND until step 28)
use Qtip to apply gel to the back of the subject's neck 
wipe with alcohol prep pad and paper towel 
use Qtip to apply gel to the left and right mastoids
wipe with alcohol prep pad and paper towel
use Qtip to apply gel below the left eye 
apply gel to left and right mastoid 
wipe with alcohol prep pad and paper towel
Plug electrodes into the impedance meter and turn on the impedance meter
blue and/or red gets plugged into the +/-
green is always neutral
peel back the sticker on the red electrode and place on the back of the skull (base of neck) to the left or right of the spinal cord 
repeat for blue electrode on the other side of the base of the neck to the left or right of the spinal cord
press the white button on the impedance meter to turn it on
Place the corresponding electrodes from the white cap electrodes onto the left and right horizontal eye and below the left eye  
fill a syringe with gel
stir gel into each electrode using the back of a Qtip
use the green electrode on the impedance meter to ensure that every electrode reads a ch of under 50 kilo ohms 
when reading the red and blue electrodes, place the meter next to and slightly below the electrodes using the green electrode, do not place on top
place on top for the white ones
place cap on the head (tag in the back)
fill the electrodes with gel and stir the inside of the electrrodes with a qtip
measure with impedance meter to make sure the ch reads below 50 kilo ohms 
place the GRND electrode in 
remove the red and blue electrodes from the back of the neck
ask subject to bring the box with them as they move into the testing chamber
